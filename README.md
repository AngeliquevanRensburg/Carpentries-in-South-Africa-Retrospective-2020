## Goal 1: Establish Communications Platform for African Carpentries Community
### :star: Review, update and maintain communications platforms aimed at the African Carpentries Community
#### [Slack](https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/CR7AT9F08)
- Channel was introduced in 2020 and have 35 members
#### [TopicBox](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/local-africa)
- This medium will become the main form of email communication from 1 January 2021.
- Currently have 70 members
#### [Google Group Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/african-carpentry-instructors)
- Migrating all communications to TopicBox as of 31 December 2020
#### [African Instructors Monthly Meet-up](https://pad.carpentries.org/ZA-community-call)
- Monthly calls, moving away from pre/post workshops discussion but how instructors are dealing with COVID and teaching online, what infrastructure has helped etc. African  solutions for African problems. Attendees from Botswana, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, United Kingdom, South Africa, Sweden, United Kingdom and the United States of America. 
#### [African Carpentries Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=carpentries.org_n76b9g2l00lqt6bskmrk0umfas@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Africa/Johannesburg)
- This calendar is copied to Community Calendar and indicate monthly African Carpentries Meet-ups
#### [Carpentries in Africa - Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/regional_communities/african_task_force.html)
- Continuously updated throughout 2020 with latest developments in the region including blog posts of happenings on the continent. 
#### [The Carpentries in South Africa - Carpentries.org](https://carpentries.org/regions_za/)

#### [Teaching Data Skills in Africa: A Conversation with Angelique van Rensburg](https://selormtamakloe.medium.com/teaching-data-skills-in-africa-a-conversation-with-angelique-van-rensburg-c0b548904e7b)

### :star:Address issues of equity and access appropriate to the region (including but not limited to religion, race and ethnic background, sexual orientation and gender identity, timezone, etc)
#### Embarked on a thematic literature review to identify challenges when teaching programming on the continent. The review consisted of various levels:
- Review literature on issues of equity, access, diversity and inclusivity regarding the teaching of basic coding skills in Africa 
- Identify Themes
- Present findings to Core Team during [Lab meeting](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18HGHx6jp0Db7Nnlmh81xiEIXVrIK_SF2uq1Ya4-43YE/edit#slide=id.g8821cc9f2c_0_152)
- Identify possible projects aligned with Carpentries values, mission and vision. Possible project were divided into initiatives aimed on Global, Regional or Instructor Training   levels: 
##### Currently active projects
  - GLOBAL: **[Glosario](https://carpentries.github.io/glosario/)** is an open source glossary of terms used in data science that is available online and also as a library in both R and Python. By adding glossary keys to a lesson’s metadata, authors can indicate what the lesson teaches, what learners ought to know before they start, and where they can go to find that knowledge. Authors can also use the library’s functions to insert consistent hyperlinks for terms and definitions in their lessons in any of several languages.
  - GLOBAL: Partner with organisations to promote equity, inclusion and access: We are partnering with the following institutions in Africa to promote the development of an African Carpentries Community. Focussing on African solutions to African problems
    * **[WACREN](https://wacren.net/en/news/women-wacren-physical-computing-python)**: Developing an asynchronous course for R with the use of the Carpentries lessons. 
    * **[Open Computational Inclusion and Digital Equity Resource](https://selgebali.gitbook.io/opencider/)**: Monthly meetings with OpenCIDER who offers a space for sharing knowledge, advice, good practices, workflows and tools to facilitate computational training and big data analysis. They have a particular interest in low bandwidth countries and solutions. 
    * **[Bioinformatics Hub of Kenya](https://bioinformaticshubofkenya.wordpress.com/)**: Mentoring the grown of a Carpentries community in Kenya. 
    
##### Project for future consideration

- GLOBAL: Additional resources to accompany lessons (cheat sheets; videos; app; asynchronous resources): [Mindmapping of lessons](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NZbI2_ftYdGFTOZWjgrzb7ssN33Wu96j6bblKKirJZw/edit)
- GLOBAL: Datasets - access to more diverse datasets
- REGIONAL/GLOBAL: Multilingual instruction - basic translations within workshops by a native speaker
- ITT: How to support learning difficulties
- ITT: Computer literacy module - partner with other institution (i.e Google for Africa)
- ITT: Addressing cognitive load issues (i.e when English is not your first language)


### Milestones achieved
:star: Review, update and maintain communications platforms aimed at the African Carpentries Community

### Ongoing milestones
:star: Address issues of equity and access appropriate to the region (including but not limited to religion, race and ethnic background, sexual orientation and gender identity, timezone, etc)
