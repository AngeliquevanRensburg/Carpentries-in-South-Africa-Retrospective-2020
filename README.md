Teaching Data Skills in Africa: A Conversation with Angelique van Rensburg
Address issues of equity and access appropriate to the region (including but not limited to religion, race and ethnic background, sexual orientation and gender identity, timezone, etc)
Embarked on a thematic literature review to identify challenges when teaching programming on the continent. The review consisted of various levels:
Review literature on issues of equity, access, diversity and inclusivity regarding the teaching of basic coding skills in Africa 
Identify Themes
Present findings to Core Team during Lab meeting
Identify possible projects aligned with Carpentries values, mission and vision. Possible project were divided into initiatives aimed on Global, Regional or Instructor Training levels: 
Currently active projects
GLOBAL: Glossario 
Glosario is an open source glossary of terms used in data science that is available online and also as a library in both R and Python. By adding glossary keys to a lesson’s metadata, authors can indicate what the lesson teaches, what learners ought to know before they start, and where they can go to find that knowledge. Authors can also use the library’s functions to insert consistent hyperlinks for terms and definitions in their lessons in any of several languages.
GLOBAL: Partner with organisations to promote EIA
We are partnering with the following institutions in Africa to promote the development of an African Carpentries Community. Focussing on African solutions to African problems
WACREN
Developing an asynchronous course for R with the use of the Carpentries lessons. 
OpenCider
OpenCIDER (Open Computational Inclusion and Digital Equity Resource) offers a space for sharing knowledge, advice, good practices, workflows and tools to facilitate computational training and big data analysis. They have a particular interest in low bandwidth countries and solutions. 
BKHi
