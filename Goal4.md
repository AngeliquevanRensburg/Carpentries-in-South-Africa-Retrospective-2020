## Goal 4: Instructor Training 2020
### :star: Arrange at least two instructor training workshops for 2020
- One instructor training [event](https://nwu-eresearch.github.io/2020-07-27-ttt-online-SAST/) took place 27-30 July, 09:00-13:00 online 
  - Four trainers from South Africa
    - Martin Dreyer
    - Angelique van Rensburg
    - Juan Steyn
    - Caroline Ajilogba
  - 12 learners
  - 4 checked out (3 x DC, 1 X LC)
    - They have taught online workshops and/or acted as helpers post-training
  - NWU offered seats to other South Africa universities to promote the Carpentries and to support the membership program
  - Continuously following up with the check-out process for those still wanting to complete checkout
  - Initiatives are needed to support/encourage check-out in future instructor training events 
- SADiLaR opted for 2 instructor training events in 2021 post-pandemic. Therefore the aim has been reduced to arranging one instructor training workshop in 2020.
