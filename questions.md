### Did you have the right number of projects for your team?
For now yes, as we grow we might need another team member to support with administrative tasks, so more focus could be given to strategic tasks for the region. 
What resources, data, or metrics did you need that you didn’t have? 
It's not a matter of did not have, perhaps didn't know were needed or existed. Brainstorming with Kari helped a lot, to either find, develop or get the necessary resources.
What took longer than expected?
Organising in-person workshops - had difficulty to get concrete dates, times etc for hosting of workshops by institutions. The pandemic did not help either. Had a recent discussion with Naoe Tatara and it seems also to be the case in the Nordic Region. 
To hash out what the role of Regional Consultant entails.
SADiLaR expectations regarding the role of the Regional Consultant.
Expectations from SADiLaR regarding the Regional Consultant role. 
Membership drive
Had discussions with three organisations
As the pandemic hit and universities needed to move their focus to funding laptops and data to students discussions were halted. 
Organisations needed funds for basic needs to students
What took shorter than expected?
Administrative tasks
Updating communications platforms
Updating Carpentries Handbook
Updating Carpentries.org
Updating Workshop Administration workflow
Did you need to change the goals for the project?
2020 Meetup to two virtual skill-up sessions
Carrying over 1 instructor training event to 2021 (per request from SADiLaR)
How did the process of making decisions about the project work?
I did most of the decision making but brainstormed with Kari if I wasn’t clear
How does each team member feel about the level and types of communication within the team that was happening?
Can’t really answer that question at the moment since it is only Kari and myself in the project. 
Serah and Omar also played a role in communicating about the project on socials/blog posts etc.
