Identified five universities
- The University of KwaZulu Natal (UKZN)
  - Multiple attempts to communicate with University without any response. An established Carpentries community at UKZN no response to any communication
- The University of Cape Town (UCT)
  - Not looking for membership at this moment. Reached our regarding Data Carpentry workshops (via SADiLaR) in 2021)
- The University of Stellenbosch (US)
  - Interested however do not have the funding
- University of Witwatersrand (WITS)
  - Multiple attempts to communicate with University without any response
  - Hosted Data Carpentry workshop January 2020 for Masters of data Science students. 
- The University of Western Cape (UWC)
  - Interested however do not have the funding
  - In-person workshop organised at UWC but had to cancel due to pandemic. 
  - Discussions around membership led to a deeper relationship with UWC, promoting workshops, attendance of African Carpentries meetup, as well as an additional instructor at UWC. 

Communique regarding the developments in The Carpentries have been forwarded to the five universities throughout 2020 (i.e. Carpentry Clippings) to highlight that even through the pandemic we have been capacitating scholars and researchers with foundational coding and data analytic skills. The North-West University offered 5 seats during instructor training to South African Universities as an initiatve to build the community during 2020. 

*Note: Due to pandemic all discussions were halted by organisations, their priority was to support student basic needs (i.e access to laptops and data). Funding for membership, for the most part, has been limited. Organisations have hinted that since fees are in USD aimed at developed economies this might be a hindrance to taking up membership.*
