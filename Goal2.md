Communique regarding the developments in The Carpentries have been forwarded to the five universities throughout 2020 (i.e. Carpentry Clippings) to highlight that even through the pandemic we have been capacitating scholars and researchers with foundational coding and data analytic skills. The North-West University offered 5 seats during instructor training to South African Universities as an initiatve to build the community during 2020. 

*Note: Due to pandemic all membership discussions for 2020 were halted by organisations, their priority was to support student basic needs (i.e access to laptops and data). Funding for membership, for the most part, has been limited. Organisations have hinted that since fees are in USD aimed at developed economies this might be a hindrance to taking up membership.*
