## Goal 3: Workshop Administration

##:star: Evaluate, Adapt/Integrate current Workshop Administration Workflow with African/SADILAR/MoU needs
- The following workflows have been adapted:
  - [Centrally organised workshops - South Africa](https://app.asana.com/0/1157016697286612/list)
  - [Self-organised workshops - South Africa](https://app.asana.com/0/1189471572757647/list)
  - [SADiLaR workshops](https://app.asana.com/0/1189471572757642/list)
    - Aim to conduct skill-up early 2021 on the process of organising a workshop in South Africa. 
### :star: Recruitment for Workshops (SADiLaR as per MoU)
- Pre-pandemic
    - Reached out to 2019 hosts to organise workshops for 2020
    - Difficulty in getting hold of hosts, getting commitment and dates for workshops though the workshops would have been paid by SADiLaR
  - 1 In-person workshops completed
  - 2 in-person workshops cancelled due to pandemic
- Pandemic
    - As the pandemic hit all in-person workshops arranged were cancelled.
    - Changed approach to SADiLaR hosting online workshops as per [blog post](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/05/south-africa-online-workshop/)
     - A lot was learnt from the initial pilot and a full 2-day workshop was replaced with a 5-half day workshop. 
- During the pandemic SADiLaR became the actual hosts of workshops, the need arose to clarify what role the RC and SADiLaR will be taking in hosting online workshops.
 - [This was addressed in consultation with the new agreement and strategic planning will fill in any gaps](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d7iTxamHS-yBffDYSBBdPOLpqblQRUHg_oHOWvRDsFw/edit#gid=0)
