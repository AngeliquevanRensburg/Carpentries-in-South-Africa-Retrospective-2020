Goal 3: Workshop Administration

Evaluate, Adapt/Integrate current Workshop Administration Workflow with African/SADILAR/MoU needs
The following workflows have been adapted:
Centrally organised workshops - South Africa
Self-organised workshops - South Africa
SADiLaR workshops
Aim to conduct skill-up early 2021 on the process of organising a workshop in South Africa. 
Recruitment for Workshops (SADiLaR as per MoU)
Pre-pandemic
Reached out to 2019 hosts to organise workshops for 2020
Difficulty in getting hold of hosts, getting commitment and dates for workshops though the workshops would have been paid by SADiLaR
1 In-person workshops completed
2 in-person workshops cancelled due to pandemic
Pandemic
As the pandemic hit all in-person workshops arranged were cancelled.
Changed approach to SADiLaR hosting online workshops as per blog post
A lot was learnt from the initial pilot and a full 2-day workshop was replaced with a 5-half day workshop. 
During the pandemic SADiLaR became the actual hosts of workshops, the need arose to clarify what role the RC and SADiLaR will be taking in hosting online workshops.
This was addressed in consultation with the new agreement and strategic planning will fill in any gaps

Milestones achieved:
Evaluate, Adapt/Integrate current Workshop Administration Workflow with African/SADILAR/MoU needs
Recruitment for Workshops (SADiLaR as per MoU)
